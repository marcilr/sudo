sudo - Provide limited super user privileges to specific users


Adding users to sudo
====================
In order for a non-root user to make use of sudo, they either
have to be added to the sudoers file using visudo, or added
to the sudo group.  Because this is Debian, everyone that is
in the sudo group has full sudo access.  So instead of messing
with the sudoers file, we're going to add our users to the
sudo group.  I've always found this a much cleaner method on
Debian.  To do this, open your terminal window, su to the root
user, and issue the following command:

  usermod -aG sudo USERNAME

Where USERNAME is the name of the user to be added.

Once the user logs out and logs back in, they will have full
access to sudo.  At this point, you no longer have to log into
your Debian minimal server as root to get things done.  Log in
as a user who belongs to the sudo group and you'll have full
admin rights to your server.
